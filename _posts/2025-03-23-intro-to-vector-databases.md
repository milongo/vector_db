# What is a vector database?

"A vector database is a database that can store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers)" [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database). Each item in a vector corresponds to a feature of an object of interest. For example, we can vectorize words by having a list of 26 numbers and counting the number of occurrences of each letter in the world. There are many ways to vectorize different kinds of data, and some are more useful than others, depending on the task at hand.
